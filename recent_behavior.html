  <p>This section is dedicated to the odd behavoirs and manuerisms "Kitteh" exhibits. These behaviors will be used as evidence for the Nazi Spy Theory.</p>

  <p>The subject has been recently interested in the wireless router that provides us with internet to our wireless devices. While the blinking lights seem to have drawn her initial interest, the emenating heat seems to peak her curiosity. With her primitive knowledge of modern technology, I do not believe she knows what the internet is or how it has granted us knowledge without boundries. We will attempt to not reveal these secrets to her, but she seems to engage in behavior in an attempt to understand the internet.</p>
  <p>Through conversations heard between her human captors, she has picked up the phrase "surfing the internet". The latest behavior, pictured above, is what we have decided is her response in trying to access the internet and its inherent powers.</p>
  <p>We will continue to monitor this behavoir and hope she never understands the true way to harness the internet's capabilities. This will inevitably involve her telling her commanding officers the effects of the internet and might lead to its downfall.</p>
